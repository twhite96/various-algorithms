# Various Algorithms

> Algorithms I've completed from different kata and bootcamp sites.

There are a plethora of code challenges on the web. I have participated in some, at places like [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/twhite96), [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/twhite96), [CodeFights](https://codefights.com/profile/twhite96), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/twhite96/) which I have a *terrible* rating because test cases passed but the submission was wrong ðŸ˜•, [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/tiffanywhitedev?hr_r=1), and the algorithm challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/twhite96).

I am currently looking to dig more into CodeFights and CodeWars, as well as start studying algorithms in the [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th ed. repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015/tree/50cfea6b2aa9bddf1ecdd9d420e47133dbfa682b) after working the problems in the book.

## Some Examples

Here is one algorithm I solved for CodeFights:

> Century from Year

> Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.


```javascript
function centuryFromYear(year) {
  return Math.floor((year - 1) / 100) + 1;
}
```
Here, I am getting a random year using `Math.floor`, dividing by 100 to get the beginning of the century, and adding one to the year to get the start of the century.

## More Updates as I Get to The Problems

My time is currently spent learning React and looking for more work. In the meantime I practice algorithms when I can so check back here if you're interested.
