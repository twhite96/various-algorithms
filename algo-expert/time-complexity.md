# Time Complexity

> Time complexity is how fast an algorithm runs as the size of the input increases.

- `O(1)`: constant time, as n increases, speed of the algorithm remains constant
- `O(n)`: linear time, the time complexity of the algorithm increases as tht size of the input increases (a sum algorithm, for example)
- `O(n²)`: exponential time: for each input in the array, we traverse the entire array `n` times.
- asymptotic analysis: `f(n)` as `n` goes towards ∞
- an elementary operation is accessing a single memory slot is constant time
